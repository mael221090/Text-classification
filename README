To launch the script, you need to type the following command in a shell: python script.py.

Then, a menu will appear and will allow you to choose and execute the options you desire to investigate.

Example of the menu:
********************* Start of the program *********************
* 1 - Collect the data from the 21 SGML files                  *

* 2 - Feature selection with LDA (Topic modelling)             *

* 3 - Feature selection with LDA and tfIdf combined            *

* 4 - Classification using best features                       *

* 5 - Clustering using the entire dataset                      *

****************************************************************
Please, select the option you desire:

The first option allows you to collect the data from the SGML files which have to be placed
within the folder "reuters21578" at the root of the project. Note that for computational
purposes, the raw data is then stored in a CSV file called "collection.csv" at the root
of the project.

The second option will use the LDA to select features and will apply the classifiers.

The third option will combined the features selected from both the LDA and the top 1000 most
frequent terms. The classifiers are then applied.

The fourth option will use the top 1000 most frequent terms. The classifiers are then 
applied.

The fifth and last option will apply the clustering algorithms.

Note that for any options, you do not need to collect the data by selecting the first option.
Each option are independent and will either collect the data from the SGML files or from
the CSV file.
